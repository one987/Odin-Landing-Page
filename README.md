# Odin-Landing-Page
Attempt at using what I've learned to recreate a landing page. 

I'm going to be trying my best to make a nice landing page from scratch using what I've learned over the past three weeks with FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project. Should be fun but I know I'm going to be running into some roadblocks.


Alright that was fun!
The webpage is mostly finished but I will go back and add some content to the placeholders and change the text a bit. For now this will do.
